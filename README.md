# How I Transition into Data Analytics (Self-Study Route)

Hello, I'm Katie! 🙋🏻‍♀️

I'm sharing this based on my self-study journey and studying style.

**📕 My Study Style**
- I prefer watching videos rather than reading textbooks because I'm a **visual person** and need to see how the code works on my screen.
- I'm more disciplined when I take paid courses because I've paid for them, so I have to complete them and not waste money 😅. 
- I'm not a textbook person, but I recently purchased the Python for Data Analysis book so this might change... 👀

**🧐 What You Need to Know?**
- Self-studying is **very challenging** because there is no syllabus, lecturers, or classmates to guide or help you out.
- Have to be **very, very, very resourceful** in looking for solutions and resolving errors.
- It can take months and years, so if you're pressed for time, then I would not recommend the self-study route.
- It's **doable** with consistency, hard work and determination. 🤓

**Disclaimer**: I'm not an expert. Just a fellow transitioner who wants to help another transitioner.

## How and Where to Start?

So, you're interested, but you're not sure where to start, how to start, or just unsure if this is the **right path** for you. 🧐

First, I'd recommend you to take a **general data analytics course**, either the [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or the [IBM Data Analyst](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?). 

Both courses provides:
- An **overview of data analytics**
- An **introduction of the skills/tools** which you'll need to learn
- Flexible, study-at-your-own-pace courses
- Relatively inexpensive. You can apply for financial aid and study for free.

Both courses are available on Coursera at USD 20-40/month depending on when you enrol. I paid USD 39/month (for Google's) last year and a friend recently only paid USD20+/month. 

Usually, people take an average of 2 to 4 months to complete the course. The faster you complete, the less you pay. 😇

**💡 My Experience**

I took Google's course because it was newer (released in March 2021) compared to IBM's course. 

The only difference is **Google teaches R** and **IBM teaches Python**. However, since both courses are beginner-level and don't go in-depth, I suggest taking Google's course. The lessons taught in R and Python are very basic and you're going to need to take up additional studying so don't worry too much. 

**‼️IMPORTANT‼️** 
- The course says that you will learn everything you need to know to be job-ready. That is not true. 🥲
- What you learn from this course is **NOT ENOUGH to get an entry-level job** or pass a technical interview.
- At most, the course contributed to 5% or less in my learning.  

Thus, I'm sharing the following resources for you to continue on with your studies after the completion of the course. 

## What are the Technical Skills to Learn?

Study in this order (**recommended**):
1. SQL
2. Tableau (or, Power BI)
3. Python & Statistics

**💡 My Experience**
- SQL is the easiest to study and **COMPULSORY** skill in any Data Analyst (or -related) role. 
- Understanding SQL concepts helps in learning Tableau (i.e. creating Calculated Fields), hence why I suggested studying SQL first, followed by Tableau.
- Usually, Python is a _good-to-have_ skill, but in some companies, it's a _must-have_ skill. 
- If you're moving towards the Data Scientist or Data Engineer route, then you must be **proficient** in Python.

### 💻 Which SQL Software to Use?

These are the most commonly free-to-use SQL software. In tech-speak, we call them SQL flavours. 
- MySQL (Windows and Mac) - [https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
- PostgreSQL (Windows and Mac) - [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Microsoft SQL Server (only on Windows) - I'm not sure because I can't run this on my Mac.

# 📊 Where to Learn Tableau

I did not take any course on Tableau as it's relatively easy to learn being a **drag-and-drop software**, so I learn it on-the-job by watching YouTube and reading articles. You can also learn by simply doing projects.
