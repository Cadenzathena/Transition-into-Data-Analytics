# How I Transition into Data Analytics (Self-Study Route)

Hello I'm Katie!

This is my personal experience based on my study style.

**📕 My Study Style**
- I prefer watching videos rather than reading textbook because I'm a visual person and need to see how the code works.
- I'm more disciplined when I take paid courses, because I've paid for them and so, I have to complete them (and not waste money 😅). 
- I'm not a textbook person, but I recently purchased the Python for Data Analysis book so this might change... 👀

**🧐 What You Need to Know?**
- It can get tough because there is no syllabus, lecturers, or classmates to guide or help you out. 
- Must-have skill: Have to be **very, very, very resourceful** in looking for solutions. 
- It can take months and years, so if you can't afford to study leisurely, then you're better off taking Masters or bootcamp.
- It's do-able with consistency, hard work and determination. 🤓

## How and Where to Start?

So, you're interested in Data Analytics, but unsure where to start, how to start, or just unsure if this is the **right path** for you. 🧐

I'd recommend you to take a **general course**, either the [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or the [IBM Data Analyst](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?).

Both courses are available on Coursera at USD 20-40/month (depending when you enrol). Usually, people take an average of 2-4 months to complete them.

**💡 My Experience**

I took Google's course because it was newer as it was released in March 2021. I'm not sure about IBM's course.

Only difference is Google teaches R and IBM teaches Python. However, since both courses are beginner-level and don't go in-depth, I suggest taking the Google course. The lessons taught on R and Python are very basic and you're going to need to take additional courses on them so don't worry too much. 



## What are the Technical Skills to Learn?

Study in this order:
1. SQL
2. Tableau (or, Power BI)
3. Python 

**💡 My Experience**
- SQL is the easiest to study and it's the COMPULSORY skill in any Data Analyst (or related) roles. 
- Having an understanding in SQL concepts helps in learning Tableau (in Calculated Fields), hence why I suggested to study SQL first, followed by Tableau.
- Most of the time, Python is a good-to-have skill, but in some companies, Python is compulsory. Also, if you're moving towards the Data Scientist or Data Engineering route, then you would have to be proficient in Python.

## 📊 Where to Learn Tableau

I did not take any course on Tableau as it's a drag-and-drop software, so I learn on-the-job by watching YouTube and reading articles. You can easily learn by doing projects.
