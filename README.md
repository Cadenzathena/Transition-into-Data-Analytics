# How I Transition into Data Analytics

This is a self-study route. Again, this is my experience and based on my study self, so it may not be applicable to everyone.

My Study Style
- I prefer watching videos with assignments so that I can follow through.
- I'm more disciplined when I study from paid courses, because I've paid for them and so, I have to complete them (and not waste money!). Well, it's working so..
- I'm not a textbook person.

Skills you'll need

Study in this order:
1. SQL
2. Tableau (or Power BI)
3. Python 

- SQL is the easiest to study and it's the COMPULSORY skill in any Data Analyst (or related) roles. 
- You'll need some of SQL concept to be able to write Calculated Fields in Tableau, hence having SQL understanding helps in learning Tableau.
- Python is usually a good-to-have skill, but if in some companies, Python is a compulsory skill and if you're moving towards the Data Scientist or Data Engineering route, then you'll have to be proficient in Python.

## To Get Started

If you're interested in Data Analytics, but unsure where to start, how to start, or just unsure if this is the right path for you.

I would recommend you to take a general data analytics course, either the [Google Data Analytics](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or the [IBM Data Analyst](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst?).

Both courses are available on Coursera at USD 20-40 a month (depending when you enrol).

I took Google's course because it was newer (released in March 2021). 

The only difference is Google teaches R and IBM teaches Python. However, both courses are for beginner and don't go in-depth, so I suggest taking the Google course because it's newer and updated with the latest updates and technology. The lessons taught on R and Python are very basic and you're going to need to take additional courses on them so don't worry too much.

### 💻 Download SQL Softwares

These are the most commonly used SQL softwares. In tech-speak, we call them SQL flavours. 
- MySQL (Windows and Mac) - [https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
- PostgreSQL (Windows and Mac) - [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Microsoft SQL Server (only on Windows)

## How to learn Tableau

TBH, I did not take any course on Tableau because it's a click-and-drop software, so I learn on-the-job by watching YouTube. You can easily learn it by taking guided projects and following the steps.
